# django-piface
Django PiFace integration on Raspbian Jessie

# In progress
I am trying to get pifacedigital_emulator so that this application can be tested without having to
be loaded onto a raspberrypi with the piface. Unfortunately the piface emulator is very poorly documented.

## Warning
pifacedigital_emulator only works on python 3 and requires pyside which only works with python <=3.4
